    "What digital tools (if any) do you currently use to track your under-level fair progress, and how effective are they?",
    "How challenging is it to access real-time updates or changes during under-level fair rounds?",
    "Would a digital platform that tracks your fair progress, deadlines, and required steps improve your experience? Why or why not?",
    "Have you ever missed or delayed a fair round due to unclear or late information? How could digital reminders or notifications help?",
    "Would a centralized digital portal for handling administrative tasks (e.g., course registration, fee payments) make these processes easier? Why?",
    "When you face issues with registration or fee payments, how easy is it to find a digital solution or contact support online?",
    "Would you prefer a self-service platform where you can resolve common issues (e.g., printing forms, checking deadlines) without visiting school offices?",
    "What are your biggest frustrations when managing academic tasks online (e.g., slow platforms, outdated information, no notifications)?",
    "If you had a personal dashboard to view all academic deadlines, announcements, and support in one place, how would that impact your daily school life?",
    "How often do you struggle to find digital support for resolving school-related issues (e.g., submitting complaints, tracking requests)? What could improve this?",
    "How often do you struggle with outdated or inconsistent information online? What kind of digital solution would help you trust official updates?",
    "Would you find it useful to have a personalized notification system that reminds you of deadlines, meetings, and school activities?",
    "What digital features (e.g., automated reminders, online appointment booking, real-time notifications) would make your school experience smoother?",
    "If the ICT department could create one digital tool to ease student life, what would you want it to do?",
    "What other digital solutions do you believe would improve communication and academic processes at NDU?",
    "What digital solutions from other platforms (e.g., mobile apps, student portals) do you wish NDU had?",
